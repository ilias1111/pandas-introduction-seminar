# How to Train Your Pandas

The repo includes the resources for a Pandas introductive seminar, focused on data manipulation. The event included a presentation and workshop afterward. 

The audience we had in mind was people who knew python but had little to no experience of Pandas.

The event was hosted by [IEEE University of Patras](https://github.com/IEEE-SB-Univ-of-Patras) and held in greek.
